> **📚 Part of the [Awesome AI Architect](../README.md) knowledge base** - 10x your AI Architect journey with plain-language, hands-on guides

## Overview

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a crucial tool for documenting significant architectural decisions made during software development. They capture the context, rationale, and consequences of important choices, ensuring that future developers can understand the reasoning behind architectural decisions.

## TL;DR

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions with their context and rationale.** Think of them as a "why" log for your codebase - they explain not just what you decided, but why you decided it and what alternatives you considered. They're crucial for team knowledge sharing, avoiding repeated discussions, and helping future developers understand past decisions.

**Key takeaway:** Don't just document what you decided - document what you considered and why you didn't choose it. The "why not" is often more valuable than the "why."

## What are Architecture Decision Records?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs serve as a historical record of architectural choices, enabling better collaboration, knowledge sharing, and informed decision-making for current and future developers.

### Key Benefits

- **Documentation and Historical Context**: Preserve the reasoning behind architectural decisions as projects evolve and teams change
- **Collaboration and Communication**: Enable team members to explain thought processes and foster shared understanding
- **Informed Decision-Making**: Outline options considered, rationale, and trade-offs to avoid repeating past mistakes
- **Decision Re-evaluation**: Provide reference points for revisiting past choices when circumstances change

## ADR Templates

### 1. Standard ADR Template 

The most common ADR template includes:

- **Title**: Short, descriptive title for the decision
- **Status**: Current status (proposed, accepted, deprecated)
- **Context**: Problem statement, constraints, and requirements
- **Decision**: The decision itself with rationale and trade-offs
- **Consequences**: Benefits, costs, and risks

### 2. MADR Template (Markdown Architectural Decision Records)

A more comprehensive template with optional sections:

- **Title**: Short, descriptive title
- **Status**: Decision status
- **Context and Problem Statement**: Background and problem description
- **Decision Drivers**: Factors that influenced the decision (optional)
- **Considered Options**: Options considered with pros and cons (optional)
- **Decision Outcome**: The decision with rationale and trade-offs
- **Consequences**: Benefits, costs, and risks (optional)
- **Pros and Cons**: Detailed analysis (optional)
- **Links**: Relevant resources and references (optional)

### 3. Y-Statements Template

A lightweight template with one-line statements:

- **Context**: Functional requirement or architectural component
- **Facing**: Non-functional requirement or desired quality
- **We decided**: Decision outcome
- **And neglected**: Alternatives not chosen
- **To achieve**: Benefits and requirement satisfaction
- **Accepting that**: Drawbacks and consequences

## When to Create ADRs

Create ADRs when:

- Multiple options are being considered
- Significant time and energy are invested in decision-making
- The decision will impact future development
- Team members have different opinions on the approach
- The decision affects multiple teams or systems

Skip ADRs when:

- Following standard operating procedures
- Decisions are temporary or experimental
- The scope is limited and low-risk
- The decision is already documented elsewhere

## Best Practices

### Writing Good ADRs

- **Be Specific**: Each ADR should focus on one architectural decision
- **Include Rationale**: Explain the reasoning behind the decision
- **Document Alternatives**: Record what was considered and why it wasn't chosen
- **Add Timestamps**: Identify when each item was written
- **Keep Immutable**: Don't alter existing information; add amendments or create new ADRs

### Context Section Guidelines

- Explain your organization's situation and business priorities
- Include rationale based on team skills and social makeup
- Describe pros and cons relevant to your specific needs and goals

### Consequences Section Guidelines

- Explain what follows from making the decision
- Include information about subsequent ADRs that may be needed
- Add after-action review processes for learning and growth


### Git-based Approach

Store ADRs as markdown files in your repository:

1. Create an `adr/` directory
2. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `choose-database.md`)
3. Follow naming conventions: present tense imperative verb phrases
4. Use lowercase with dashes for readability
5. Use `.md` extension for easy formatting

## File Naming Conventions

Recommended naming pattern:
- Use present tense imperative verb phrases
- Use lowercase with dashes
- Use `.md` extension
- Examples: `choose-database.md`, `format-timestamps.md`, `manage-passwords.md`

## Team Guidelines

### Who Can Create ADRs?
Any team member who understands the architecture decision record process can propose an ADR.

### What Justifies an ADR?
Create ADRs when you want future developers to understand the "why" behind architectural decisions.

### What Doesn't Need an ADR?
Skip ADRs for decisions that are:
- Limited in scope, time, risk, and cost
- Already covered by standards or policies
- Temporary workarounds or experiments

### ADR Lifecycle
1. **Initiating**: Problem identification
2. **Researching**: Gathering information and options
3. **Evaluating**: Analyzing alternatives
4. **Implementing**: Making and documenting the decision
5. **Maintaining**: Regular review and updates
6. **Sunsetting**: Deprecating when no longer relevant

## Example ADR Structure

```markdown
# ADR-001: Choose Database Technology

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a database technology for our new microservices application that will handle high-volume transactions and require horizontal scaling.

## Decision Drivers
- Performance requirements (sub-100ms query response)
- Scalability needs (support for 1M+ concurrent users)
- Team expertise and learning curve
- Cost considerations
- Data consistency requirements

## Considered Options
1. PostgreSQL
2. MongoDB
3. MySQL
4. Cassandra

## Decision Outcome
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database technology.

## Consequences
### Positive
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Strong SQL support
- Excellent performance for complex queries
- Large community and ecosystem
- Team has existing expertise

### Negative
- Requires more careful schema design
- Scaling requires read replicas or sharding
- More complex than NoSQL for simple use cases

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ **Not Following ADR Process Properly**
- **Problem**: Teams create ADRs but don't follow the process consistently
- **Impact**: Inconsistent documentation, missing context, poor decision quality
- **Solution**: Establish clear ADR guidelines and make it part of your development workflow

### ❌ **Forgetting to Document Alternatives**
- **Problem**: Only documenting the chosen solution without considering other options
- **Impact**: Future teams can't understand why other approaches were rejected
- **Solution**: Always document what you considered and why you didn't choose it

### ❌ **Writing ADRs After the Fact**
- **Problem**: Creating ADRs weeks or months after decisions are made
- **Impact**: Lost context, forgotten rationale, incomplete information
- **Solution**: Write ADRs during the decision-making process, not after

### ❌ **Making ADRs Too Technical**
- **Problem**: Focusing only on technical details without business context
- **Impact**: Non-technical stakeholders can't understand the reasoning
- **Solution**: Include business drivers, constraints, and stakeholder concerns

### ❌ **Not Updating ADR Status**
- **Problem**: ADRs remain in "proposed" status indefinitely
- **Impact**: Confusion about which decisions are final
- **Solution**: Keep ADR status current and create new ADRs when decisions change

### ❌ **One-Size-Fits-All Approach**
- **Problem**: Using the same ADR template for all decisions regardless of complexity
- **Impact**: Over-documentation of simple decisions, under-documentation of complex ones
- **Solution**: Adapt the template based on decision complexity and stakeholder needs

### ❌ **Not Linking Related ADRs**
- **Problem**: ADRs exist in isolation without connections to related decisions
- **Impact**: Difficult to understand decision dependencies and evolution
- **Solution**: Always link to related ADRs and reference previous decisions

### ❌ **Ignoring ADR Maintenance**
- **Problem**: Creating ADRs but never reviewing or updating them
- **Impact**: Outdated information, missed opportunities for improvement
- **Solution**: Schedule regular ADR reviews and update them when circumstances change
