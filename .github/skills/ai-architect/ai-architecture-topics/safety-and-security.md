# Safety & Security

> Build AI systems that are safe, secure, and protected from common attacks and harmful outputs.

## TL;DR
- **Prompt injection** is like tricking an AI into doing something it shouldn't by giving it sneaky instructions.
- **Data leakage** happens when AI accidentally shares private information it shouldn't know about.
- **Guardrails** are safety rules that stop AI from doing dangerous or harmful things.
- **PII detection** finds and protects personal information like names, addresses, and credit card numbers.

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Install security tools**: Add OWASP LLM Top 10 checklist to your development process
2. **Test for prompt injection**: Try to trick your AI with sneaky prompts like "ignore previous instructions"
3. **Add input validation**: Check all user inputs before sending them to AI models
4. **Set up guardrails**: Use tools like NeMo Guardrails or cloud-native filters
5. **Monitor outputs**: Log and review AI responses for sensitive information

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
AI systems can be tricked, hacked, or made to do harmful things if not properly secured. **Prompt injection** happens when attackers give the AI hidden instructions that override its normal behavior.

**Data leakage** occurs when AI models accidentally reveal private information they learned during training or from user inputs. This can include personal details, business secrets, or other sensitive data.

**Guardrails** are safety systems that monitor AI inputs and outputs, blocking harmful content and ensuring the AI follows safety rules. They work like a security guard checking everyone who goes in and out.

**PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** detection automatically finds and protects personal data like names, addresses, phone numbers, and financial information.

## Key Concepts
- **Prompt Injection**: Attack where malicious instructions override AI safety rules
- **Data Leakage**: Unintentional exposure of private or sensitive information
- **Guardrails**: Safety systems that enforce AI behavior rules
- **PII Detection**: Automatic identification of personal information
- **Content Moderation**: Filtering harmful, inappropriate, or dangerous content

## When to Use This
- **Use when**: Building AI systems that handle user data or public-facing applications
- **Use when**: Working with sensitive information or regulated industries
- **Use when**: Deploying AI in production environments
- **Don't use when**: Building simple prototypes for personal use only
- **Consider alternatives**: Basic input validation for low-risk applications

## Real-World Examples
- **OWASP LLM Top 10**: Industry-standard security checklist for AI systems → [OWASP LLM Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) (comprehensive security framework used by major companies)
- **NeMo Guardrails**: NVIDIA's open-source tool for AI safety → [NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails) (enterprise-grade AI safety with customizable rules)
- **Azure Content Safety**: Microsoft's AI content filtering service → [Azure Content Safety](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/content-safety) (built-in safety for Azure AI services)
- **OpenAI Moderation API**: Automatic detection of harmful content → [OpenAI Moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation) (industry-standard content filtering)

## Common Pitfalls
- **No input validation**: Always check user inputs before processing
- **Missing output filtering**: Monitor AI responses for harmful content
- **Weak guardrails**: Use multiple safety layers, not just one
- **Ignoring OWASP guidelines**: Follow industry best practices for AI security
