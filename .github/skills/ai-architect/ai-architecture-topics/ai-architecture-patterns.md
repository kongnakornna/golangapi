# AI Architecture Patterns

> Design and build AI systems using proven patterns like RAG, agents, and orchestration workflows.

## TL;DR
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** is like giving an AI a smart library card - it finds relevant information before answering questions.
- **Agents** are AI helpers that can use tools, make decisions, and work step-by-step like a human assistant.
- **Pipelines** connect different AI services together like an assembly line, where each step adds value.
- **Orchestration** is the conductor of an AI orchestra, making sure all the pieces work together smoothly.

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Pick your pattern**: Start with RAG if you need AI to use specific knowledge, agents if you need decision-making, or pipelines if you're connecting multiple AI services.
2. **Design the flow**: Draw boxes for each component and arrows showing how data moves between them.
3. **Test with a simple example**: Build a minimal version that works before adding complexity.
4. **Add monitoring**: Track how well each part performs and where things might break.

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
AI architecture patterns are reusable blueprints for building intelligent systems. Think of them as LEGO instructions for AI - you can mix and match different pieces to create complex systems from simple building blocks.

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** combines search with AI generation. Instead of the AI making things up, it first searches for relevant information, then uses that to give accurate answers.

**Agents** are AI systems that can plan, use tools, and make decisions. They're like having a smart intern who can figure out what needs to be done and how to do it.

**Pipelines** connect multiple AI services together. Each step processes the data and passes it to the next, like a factory assembly line.

**Orchestration** manages the flow between different AI services, handling errors, retries, and making sure everything happens in the right order.

## Key Concepts
- **RAG Pattern**: Search + Generate = Accurate answers with sources
- **Agent Pattern**: Plan + Execute + Decide = Autonomous problem-solving
- **Pipeline Pattern**: Connect + Transform = Multi-step AI processing
- **Orchestration Pattern**: Coordinate + Manage = Reliable AI workflows

## When to Use This
- **Use RAG when**: You need AI to answer questions about specific documents, knowledge bases, or recent information
- **Use agents when**: You need AI to make decisions, use multiple tools, or work through complex multi-step problems
- **Use pipelines when**: You're connecting multiple AI services or need to process data through several steps
- **Use orchestration when**: You have multiple AI services that need to work together reliably

## Real-World Examples
- **ChatGPT with browsing**: RAG pattern that searches the web before answering → [OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-browse-the-internet) (shows how RAG improves accuracy with real-time information)
- **GitHub Copilot**: Agent pattern that understands code context and suggests improvements → [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) (demonstrates AI agents in software development)
- **LangChain applications**: Pipeline pattern connecting multiple AI services → [LangChain](https://langchain.com/) (popular framework for building AI pipelines)
- **Azure AI Studio**: Orchestration platform for managing AI workflows → [Azure AI Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-studio) (enterprise-grade AI orchestration)

## Common Pitfalls
- **RAG without evaluation**: Build a small evaluation loop to test if your RAG system is actually finding the right information
- **Agents without boundaries**: Set clear limits on what tools agents can use and what decisions they can make
- **Pipelines without error handling**: Plan for failures at each step and how to recover gracefully
- **Orchestration without monitoring**: Track performance, costs, and errors across your AI system
