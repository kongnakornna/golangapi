# Advanced RAG

> Build RAG systems that move beyond basic vector search using retrieval pipelines, re-rankers, and iterative generation.

![Advanced RAG](/img/advanced-rag-patterns.png)

## TL;DR
- **Hybrid retrieval** combines vector search (semantic) with keyword search (exact matches) for 15-25% better accuracy
- **Reranking** improves precision by 20-40% but adds 50-200ms latency
- **Multi-hop retrieval** enables complex reasoning but increases costs by 2-3x
- **GraphRAG** uses knowledge graphs for 6× cheaper, more accurate complex reasoning
- **Caching** reduces costs by 60-80% for repeated queries

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Start with hybrid search**: Combine vector + keyword search for better recall
2. **Add reranking**: Use cross-encoder models like BGE-reranker for precision
3. **Consider GraphRAG**: For complex relationships and 6× cost savings
4. **Implement caching**: Cache embeddings and final responses to reduce costs
5. **Test multi-hop**: Build query chains for complex information gathering
6. **Measure everything**: Track accuracy, latency, and costs with each change

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
Basic RAG fetches a few documents and feeds them to a model. Advanced RAG adds extra retrieval steps, re-ranks results, and uses query transformations to find better context. By chaining retrieval and generation, the system can research topics, follow citations, or summarize large corpora.

## Key Concepts
- **Query Expansion** – reformulate the question with synonyms or follow-up prompts.
- **Hybrid Search** – combine dense embeddings with traditional keyword filters.
- **Reranking** – use a cross-encoder model to score and reorder retrieved chunks.
- **Multi-Hop Retrieval** – run successive searches to traverse related documents.
- **GraphRAG** – use knowledge graphs with PageRank-weighted edges for complex reasoning.
- **Caching** – store useful chunks or final answers to avoid repeated work.

## Cost & Performance Metrics

### Retrieval Performance
| Method | Accuracy | Latency | Cost/Query | Use Case |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|----------|
| Vector Search | 70-80% | 50-100ms | $0.001-0.005 | General semantic search |
| Hybrid Search | 80-90% | 80-150ms | $0.002-0.008 | Balanced accuracy/speed |
| Reranked Search | 85-95% | 150-300ms | $0.005-0.015 | High precision needed |
| Multi-hop | 90-98% | 500-2000ms | $0.010-0.050 | Complex reasoning |

### Caching Impact
- **Embedding Cache**: 60-80% cost reduction for repeated queries
- **Response Cache**: 90%+ cost reduction for identical questions
- **Chunk Cache**: 40-60% cost reduction for document processing

## GraphRAG vs Traditional RAG

GraphRAG extends traditional RAG by using knowledge graphs instead of just vector similarity. By turning documents into knowledge-graph nodes and walking PageRank-weighted edges at query time, GraphRAG delivers answers that are both cheaper (6×) and easier to trace than vector-only lookups.

### RAG vs GraphRAG Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional RAG | GraphRAG |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Retrieval Mechanism** | Vector-based similarity search | Knowledge graph traversal with PageRank |
| **Contextual Understanding** | Limited to retrieved document chunks | Enhanced by entity relationships and graph structure |
| **Complex Query Handling** | Struggles with multi-hop reasoning | Excels at multi-hop reasoning and complex relationships |
| **Explainability** | Limited transparency in reasoning | High transparency through graph traversal paths |
| **Accuracy** | 70-85% on complex queries | 85-95% on complex reasoning tasks |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Higher token usage for context | 6× cheaper due to targeted retrieval |
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple vector indexing | Requires knowledge graph construction |
| **Best For** | General semantic search, simple Q&A | Complex reasoning, research, knowledge-heavy applications |

### When to Choose GraphRAG

**Use GraphRAG when:**
- Your data has complex relationships (e.g., Wikipedia, research papers, legal documents)
- You need multi-hop reasoning capabilities
- Explainability and traceability are crucial
- You're building knowledge-heavy applications
- Cost optimization is important (6× cheaper than traditional RAG)

**Use Traditional RAG when:**
- Your data is primarily unstructured text
- You need fast, simple semantic search
- Relationships between entities are not critical
- You're prototyping or have limited resources for graph construction
- Your queries are straightforward and don't require complex reasoning

### GraphRAG Implementation

1. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
   - Extract entities and relationships from documents
   - Build graph structure with nodes (entities) and edges (relationships)
   - Apply PageRank algorithm to weight edge importance

2. **Query Processing**
   - Parse query to identify key entities
   - Traverse graph using PageRank-weighted paths
   - Retrieve relevant subgraphs instead of document chunks

3. **Response Generation**
   - Use retrieved graph context for more accurate responses
   - Provide traceable reasoning paths
   - Generate explanations based on graph traversal
