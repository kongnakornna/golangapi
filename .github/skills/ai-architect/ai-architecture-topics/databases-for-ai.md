# Databases for AI

> Choose the right database technology for each part of your AI stack.

## TL;DR
- **Relational databases** store structured records and transactional data (ACID compliance, 1-10ms queries).
- **Vector stores** index embeddings for similarity search (50-200ms for 1M+ vectors).
- **Feature stores** manage versioned ML features for training and serving (10-100ms feature retrieval).
- **Metadata catalogs** track datasets, models, and lineage (enables data governance and compliance).

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. Start with a relational database for source-of-truth business data.
2. Generate embeddings and load them into a vector store for semantic search.
3. Use a feature store to share validated features between training and inference.
4. Register datasets and models in a metadata catalog for discoverability.

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
Traditional applications rely on relational databases for consistent transactions and reporting. AI systems add new storage needs:
- **Vector stores** power RAG and recommendation systems by searching high-dimensional embeddings.
- **Feature stores** provide a central hub for engineered features, ensuring training/serving consistency.
- **Metadata catalogs** document datasets, models, and experiments so teams can trace lineage and reuse assets.
These components complement relational systems rather than replace them.

## Key Concepts
- **ACID vs. Similarity**: relational DBs guarantee transactions; vector stores focus on nearest neighbor search.
- **Offline vs. Online Features**: feature stores separate batch-generated features from low-latency serving layers.
- **Lineage Tracking**: metadata catalogs record where data comes from and how models were built.
