## TL;DR
- **Weighted voting** lets models cast votes that are averaged or prioritized by confidence.
- **Specialist models** route tasks to niche models that excel in a domain.
- **Cost-aware selection** picks models based on price-performance trade-offs.

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Define your tasks** and which models might handle them best.
2. **Assign weights** to each model based on historical accuracy.
3. **Route or ensemble** requests and compare outputs.
4. **Track cost metrics** to refine when cheaper models suffice.

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
Using multiple LLMs can smooth out weaknesses of any single model. Voting schemes blend outputs, while specialist models focus on narrow domains such as legal or medical. Cost-aware logic decides when to invoke a powerful but expensive model versus a lightweight alternative.

## Key Concepts
- **Weighted Voting:** Average or rank outputs using per-model confidence scores.
- **Specialist Models:** Use domain-specific models when generalists struggle.
- **Cost-Aware Selection:** Monitor latency and pricing to pick affordable options.

## When to Use This
- **High accuracy required**: Combine models to reduce hallucinations.
- **Domain expertise needed**: Delegate niche tasks to specialists.
- **Budget constraints**: Use cost-aware routing to stay within limits.

## Real-World Examples
- **Ensemble Chatbots** combining GPT-4 and smaller models for customer support.
- **Research assistants** that send coding questions to a code-focused model and writing tasks to a general model.
- **Cost-optimized APIs** that call premium models only when cheaper ones fall below a confidence threshold.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Over-routing**: Complex routing logic can add latency.
- **Inconsistent outputs**: Ensure voting or selection criteria are well defined.
- **Untracked costs**: Always log per-model spend.

## Next Steps
- **Learn the routing logic**: [Model Routing](model-routing.md) explains strategies to pick the right model for each request.
