# On-Device vs VM

> Choose the right deployment strategy by understanding how latency, privacy, and hardware shape on-device and virtual machine inference.

## TL;DR
- **Latency**: On-device inference avoids network hops for instant responses (5-50ms), while VM-hosted models add round-trip delays (100-500ms).
- **Privacy**: Keeping data local improves confidentiality; sending it to a VM increases exposure and compliance risks.
- **Hardware**: Devices have limited memory and compute (2-8GB RAM), whereas VMs can scale with specialized accelerators (up to 80GB VRAM).
- **Cost**: On-device has zero per-request costs, VM costs scale with usage ($0.001-0.06 per 1K tokens).

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Scope your model**: Check if the model fits within memory and compute constraints of target devices.
2. **Measure latency needs**: If every millisecond matters, favor on-device; if not, remote VMs may suffice.
3. **Review data policies**: Confirm whether data can leave the device before choosing a VM deployment.

## The Idea
Running AI models locally delivers low-latency, private experiences but requires efficient models tailored to device hardware. Virtual machines offer abundant resources and simpler updates at the cost of network latency and potential privacy trade-offs.

## Key Concepts
- **Latency budgets** – Edge inference removes network delays but may be slower if the device hardware is weak.
- **Privacy boundaries** – Processing sensitive data locally reduces the risk of interception or misuse.
- **Hardware selection** – VMs can leverage GPUs or TPUs; devices may rely on mobile CPUs or NPUs.

## Decision Tree: On-Device vs VM?

```

│
├─ Is data privacy critical?
│  ├─ YES → On-device (data never leaves device)
│  └─ NO → Continue to next question
│
├─ What's your model size?
│  ├─ < 3B parameters → On-device (fits on most devices)
│  ├─ 3B-7B parameters → Depends on device specs
│  └─ > 7B parameters → VM (too large for most devices)
│
├─ What's your latency requirement?
│  ├─ < 100ms → On-device (no network latency)
│  ├─ 100-500ms → Either (depends on device power)
│  └─ > 500ms → VM (can use powerful hardware)
│
├─ Do you need offline capability?
│  ├─ YES → On-device (no internet required)

## When to Use This
- **On-device**: Offline apps, real-time interaction, strict data sovereignty, cost-sensitive applications
- **VM**: Large models, centralized management, bursty workloads, frequent updates needed
- **Hybrid**: Use on-device for simple tasks, VM for complex reasoning

## Real-World Examples
- Smartphones translating speech without an internet connection.
- Cloud-hosted LLMs serving multiple tenants via API.

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Assessment
