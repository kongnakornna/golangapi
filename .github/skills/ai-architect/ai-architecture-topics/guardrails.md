# Guardrails

> Keep your AI on track by intercepting unsafe or off-policy interactions before they reach users.

## TL;DR
- **NeMo Guardrails** lets you write structured rules that control what your AI can and can't say (5-10ms overhead).
- **Rebuff** adds protection against prompt injection and jailbreak attempts (2-5ms overhead).
- **Custom policy engines** allow you to encode organization-specific safety rules (1-20ms overhead).
- **Guardrails reduce harmful outputs by 80-95%** but may block 5-15% of legitimate requests.

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Define policies**: List the behaviors or topics your AI must avoid.
2. **Start with NeMo Guardrails**: Install the framework and create a simple YAML policy.
3. **Add Rebuff**: Deploy Rebuff as a middleware to inspect prompts and responses.
4. **Test edge cases**: Try common jailbreak prompts to ensure your rules work.
5. **Iterate**: Refine policies as new threats or use cases emerge.

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
Guardrails act like a security checkpoint for your AI system. Every request and response passes through a set of rules that decide whether it should proceed, be modified, or be blocked. Off-the-shelf frameworks like **NeMo Guardrails** provide high-level policy languages, while tools like **Rebuff** specialize in catching prompt injection. For unique business needs, teams often build **custom policy engines** to encode domain-specific rules and regulatory requirements.

## Key Concepts
- **Policy Language**: Human-readable rules that define allowed and disallowed behavior.
- **Prompt Injection Defense**: Filters and detectors that catch attempts to override system instructions.
- **Execution Hooks**: Points in your pipeline where guardrails can approve, reject, or modify requests.

## Decision Tree: Which Guardrail Strategy?

```
Start: Need to protect AI system
│
├─ What's your primary threat?
│  ├─ Prompt Injection → Use Rebuff (90-95% protection)
│  ├─ Harmful Content → Use NeMo Guardrails (85-95% protection)
│  ├─ Data Extraction → Use Custom Rules (70-85% protection)
│  └─ All threats → Use Combined approach (90-98% protection)
│
├─ What's your latency budget?
│  ├─ < 10ms → Custom Rules or Rebuff
│  ├─ 10-50ms → NeMo Guardrails
│  └─ > 50ms → LLM-based guardrails
│
├─ Do you need domain-specific rules?
│  ├─ YES → Custom Rules + NeMo Guardrails
│  └─ NO → Use off-the-shelf frameworks
│
└─ What's your accuracy requirement?
   ├─ > 95% → LLM-based guardrails
   ├─ 85-95% → NeMo Guardrails or Rebuff
   └─ < 85% → Custom Rules (faster, less accurate)
```

## Real-World Examples

- **Custom policy engine** → Build internal rule evaluators using regex, ontologies, or business logic

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Threat Assessment
- [ ] **Risk Analysis**
  - [ ] Identify potential attack vectors (prompt injection, jailbreaking, etc.)
  - [ ] Assess data sensitivity and compliance requirements
  - [ ] Define acceptable vs harmful content categories
  - [ ] Set accuracy and latency requirements
- [ ] **Policy Definition**
  - [ ] Create comprehensive policy document
  - [ ] Define escalation procedures for blocked requests
  - [ ] Set up human review workflows
  - [ ] Document false positive handling

### Phase 2: Basic Implementation
- [ ] **Framework Selection**
  - [ ] Choose guardrail framework based on decision tree
  - [ ] Install and configure selected tools
  - [ ] Set up basic rule sets
  - [ ] Test with known attack patterns
- [ ] **Integration**
  - [ ] Integrate guardrails into AI pipeline
  - [ ] Add logging and monitoring
  - [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms
  - [ ] Set up alerting for blocked requests

### Phase 3: Advanced Protection
- [ ] **Multi-Layer Defense**
  - [ ] Implement multiple guardrail layers
  - [ ] Add prompt injection detection
  - [ ] Set up content filtering
  - [ ] Configure response validation
- [ ] **Custom Rules**
  - [ ] Develop domain-specific policies
  - [ ] Create business logic validators
  - [ ] Implement context-aware filtering

- **Overly broad rules** that block legitimate requests (aim for <10% false positives)
- **Lack of monitoring** to see when and why guardrails trigger
- **Ignoring updates** as new jailbreak techniques appear
- **Single point of failure** - use multiple guardrail layers
- **No human review** for edge cases and policy updates
