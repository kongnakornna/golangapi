# Skill Guidelines

Quality standards for SKILL.md files in this repository. Read this before
creating or modifying any skill.

## Format

### YAML Frontmatter (required)

Every SKILL.md starts with YAML frontmatter between `---` markers:

```yaml
---
name: go-skill-name
description: >
  One sentence explaining what this skill does.
  Use when: "phrase 1", "phrase 2", "phrase 3".
  Do NOT use for: X (use other-skill), Y (use another-skill).
user-invocable: true
license: MIT
compatibility: Designed for Claude Code or similar AI coding agents working on Go projects. Requires the Go toolchain.
allowed-tools: Read Edit Write Glob Grep Bash(go:*) Bash(gofmt:*)
metadata:
  author: eduardo-sl
  version: "1.0.0"
---
```

All seven fields are required in this repository and enforced by
`scripts/validate.sh`.

**name**: Lowercase, hyphens only, matches directory name exactly.

**description**: Under 1024 characters. Must include:
- What it does (first sentence)
- Trigger examples with quoted phrases the user would actually say
- Negative triggers pointing to the correct skill

**user-invocable**: `true` for every skill here — the README documents
`/skill-name` invocation for all of them.

**license**: `MIT` for all skills in this repository.

**compatibility**: Under 500 characters. State the real requirements: the Go
toolchain plus any extra binary the skill drives (`gopls`, `protoc`, `dlv`).
Mark optional tools as optional. Review and audit skills end this field with
`Read-only: this skill reports findings, it does not edit code.`

**allowed-tools**: Space-delimited, least privilege. A skill gets `Edit` and
`Write` only if it changes code. `Bash(...)` must always be scoped to a
specific binary — unscoped `Bash` is rejected by the validator, because a
skill that can run anything can undo every other guarantee in this file.

| Skill kind | Tools |
|---|---|
| Writes code | `Read Edit Write Glob Grep` + scoped `Bash` |
| Reviews / audits only | `Read Glob Grep` + scoped `Bash` |

**metadata.author**: `eduardo-sl`, or the contributor's handle.

**metadata.version**: Semver, quoted. New skills start at `1.0.0`.
Bump MINOR when adding or restructuring content, PATCH for typo/example
fixes, MAJOR if the skill's scope or triggers change incompatibly.
Every commit that changes a SKILL.md body must bump its version.

### Body

Markdown content with instructions for the AI agent.

## Constraints

| Rule | Limit |
|---|---|
| Total lines | ≤ 250 (budget, CI warns) / ≤ 500 (hard, CI fails) |
| Description | ≤ 1024 characters |
| Skill name | 1-64 characters, `[a-z0-9-]` |
| Code examples | Must specify language tag |
| Headers | ATX style (`#`), max depth `###` |

## Writing Principles

### 1. Write for agents, not humans

Skills are prompts injected into an AI agent's context window. Write them as
instructions the agent can follow step by step.

```markdown
<!-- ✅ Good — imperative, actionable -->
## Error Handling
Check every returned error. Wrap with context using fmt.Errorf and %w.

<!-- ❌ Bad — educational prose -->
## Error Handling
In Go, error handling is an important concept. The language designers
chose to make errors explicit values rather than exceptions...
```

### 2. Show contrast with ✅/❌ examples

Every pattern should show both the right and wrong way. Agents learn
better from contrast than from isolated examples.

```markdown
// ✅ Good — early return
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("fetch user: %w", err)
}

// ❌ Bad — nested else
if err == nil {
    // happy path deeply nested
} else {
    return err
}
```

### 3. One concept per section

Each numbered section covers one topic. Don't mix error handling with
concurrency in the same section. If topics relate, cross-reference
the correct skill by name.

### 4. End with a verification checklist

Every skill ends with a checklist the agent can use to self-validate:

```markdown
## Verification Checklist

1. All errors checked — no blank `_` discarding errors
2. Error messages are lowercase, contextual
3. `errors.Is` / `errors.As` used instead of `==`
```

### 5. Keep examples minimal but complete

Code blocks should be the minimum code needed to demonstrate the pattern.
No imports unless they're relevant to the point. No boilerplate unless
the boilerplate IS the point.

### 6. Assume competence

The agent (and the engineer using it) understands Go basics. Don't explain
what a goroutine is — explain when to use `errgroup` vs `sync.WaitGroup`
and why.

### 7. Prefer progressive disclosure over long files

Keep SKILL.md at principles + procedure + checklist (~150-200 lines, 250
maximum). SKILL.md is loaded in full the moment the skill fires; a
`references/*.md` file costs nothing until the agent decides it needs it.
That is the whole trade: rules in the body, worked examples in references,
linked from a short block near the top:

```markdown
Detailed reference material, loaded on demand:

- `references/patterns.md` — full worked examples for X, Y, Z.

Read a reference file only when the summary below is not enough.
```

`scripts/validate.sh` verifies that every `references/` link resolves.

### 8. Give review/audit skills operating modes

Skills that both write and review code should open with an
"Operating Modes" section (e.g. diff review vs full audit) and, for
audit skills, an "Auditing Large Codebases" section describing
independent per-concern passes that can be delegated to parallel
sub-agents — phrased agent-agnostically ("if your environment supports
delegating work to parallel sub-agents or tasks...").

### 9. Make verification executable

Where a tool can prove a rule, tell the agent to run it (`go vet`,
`golangci-lint`, `govulncheck`, `go test -race`) and to skip-and-note
tools that aren't installed. A checklist item the toolchain can check
should not rely on the agent's judgment.

## Severity Classification

When skills produce findings (reviews, audits), use consistent severity:

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 | BLOCKER | Must fix. Correctness, data loss, security. |
| 🟡 | WARNING | Should fix. Maintainability, idiomatic Go. |
| 🟢 | SUGGESTION | Consider. Style, naming, documentation. |

## Directory Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: main instructions (≤250 lines)
├── references/            # Optional: detailed docs loaded on demand
│   ├── error-patterns.md
│   └── migration-guide.md
└── scripts/               # Optional: helper scripts
    └── analyze.sh
```

**SKILL.md** is the brain. Keep it focused on procedures and patterns.

**references/** holds detailed content that the agent loads only when
explicitly directed by SKILL.md (e.g., "See references/error-patterns.md
for the full error hierarchy"). This keeps the main skill lean.

**scripts/** holds executable helpers for tasks where precision matters
more than flexibility (e.g., a linter wrapper, a migration scanner).

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these in skill content:

- **Hedging language**: "You might want to consider..." → "Use X when Y."
- **Exhaustive lists**: Listing all 40 golangci-lint rules → Focus on the 10 that matter most.
- **Framework worship**: "Always use chi/gin/echo" → Explain the pattern, mention options.
- **Outdated advice**: Check that Go version requirements match current releases.
- **Hallucinated APIs**: If you're not sure a function exists, don't include it.
- **Wall of text**: If a section has no code example, it probably needs one.
