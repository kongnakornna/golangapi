# Go Test Quality

Tests are production code. They run in CI on every commit, they document behavior,
and they're the first thing you read when a function breaks at 3am.
Write them with the same care you'd give to code that handles money.

Detailed reference material, loaded on demand:

- `references/helpers-and-fixtures.md` — test helpers, factory functions
  with options, `t.Cleanup`, golden files, mock implementations.
- `references/integration-testing.md` — httptest recorder and server,
  testcontainers, build tags, `TestMain`, fuzz testing.

Read a reference file only when the summary below is not enough.

## 1. Test Design Philosophy

### Test behavior, not implementation

```go
// ✅ Good — tests what the function DOES
func TestTransferFunds_InsufficientBalance(t *testing.T) {
    from := NewAccount("alice", 100)
    to := NewAccount("bob", 0)

    err := TransferFunds(from, to, 150)

    require.ErrorIs(t, err, ErrInsufficientFunds)
    assert.Equal(t, 100, from.Balance(), "sender balance should be unchanged")
    assert.Equal(t, 0, to.Balance(), "receiver balance should be unchanged")
}

// ❌ Bad — tests HOW the function does it
// asserts debit() was called before credit(), rollback() was called,
// internal mutex was locked — breaks on every refactor
```

### One assertion per logical concept

Multiple `assert` calls are fine when they verify different facets of the
SAME behavior (both accounts after a transfer). A test that checks creation
AND update AND deletion is three tests pretending to be one.

### Name tests like bug reports

When the test fails, the name alone should say what broke:

```go
// ✅ Good — reads like a sentence
func TestOrderService_Cancel_RefundsPartiallyShippedItems(t *testing.T) { ... }
func TestParseConfig_ReturnsErrorOnMissingRequiredField(t *testing.T) { ... }

// ❌ Bad — says nothing useful
func TestCancel(t *testing.T) { ... }
func TestRateLimiter_Success(t *testing.T) { ... }
```

## 2. Subtests for Organized Scenarios

Use `t.Run` to group related scenarios under a parent test. Each subtest
gets its own setup, its own failure, and its own name in CI output:

```go
func TestUserService_Create(t *testing.T) {
    svc := setupUserService(t)

    t.Run("succeeds with valid input", func(t *testing.T) {
        user, err := svc.Create(ctx, CreateUserInput{Name: "Alice", Email: "alice@example.com"})
        require.NoError(t, err)
        assert.NotEmpty(t, user.ID)
    })

    t.Run("rejects duplicate email", func(t *testing.T) {
        _, _ = svc.Create(ctx, CreateUserInput{Name: "Alice", Email: "taken@example.com"})
        _, err := svc.Create(ctx, CreateUserInput{Name: "Bob", Email: "taken@example.com"})
        require.ErrorIs(t, err, ErrDuplicateEmail)
    })
}
```

## 3. Test Helper Rules

1. **Always call `t.Helper()`** in test utilities so failures point to the
   caller, not the helper.
2. **Factory functions with functional options** for complex test objects —
   defaults with per-test overrides, never a 15-parameter constructor.
3. **Prefer `t.Cleanup` over `defer`** — it runs even after `t.FailNow()`
   and is scoped to the test, not the function.

Full implementations in `references/helpers-and-fixtures.md`.

## 4. Choosing the Test Type

| Situation | Approach | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Pure function, 3+ data cases | Table-driven test | go-test-table-driven skill |
| HTTP handler in isolation | `httptest.NewRecorder` + mock store | `references/integration-testing.md` |
| Full routing/middleware stack | `httptest.NewServer` | `references/integration-testing.md` |
| Real database behavior | testcontainers + build tags | `references/integration-testing.md` |
| Complex output (JSON, HTML, SQL) | Golden files in `testdata/` | `references/helpers-and-fixtures.md` |
| Parser/validator on untrusted input | Fuzz test | `references/integration-testing.md` |

## 5. Mocking Rules

- **Interface-based hand-written mocks** for small interfaces (≤3 methods):
  a struct with function fields plus recorded calls.
- **Function injection** for simple seams (`now func() time.Time`).
- **Do NOT mock:** value objects, pure functions, the standard library, or
  your own code in the same package. Test the real thing.
- If you mock everything, you're testing your mocks, not your code.

## 6. Parallelism and Coverage

```go
func TestSlugify(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel() // safe: pure function, no shared state
    // ...
}
```

Do NOT use `t.Parallel()` when tests share mutable state, databases,
files, or process-level state (`os.Setenv`).

```bash
go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out
```

**Targets:** business logic 80%+, critical paths (auth, payments) 95%+,
handlers 70%+. Don't chase 100% on generated code and simple getters.

## 7. Testing Concurrent Code

Never synchronize a test with `time.Sleep`. It is slow when it works and
flaky when it does not.

`testing/synctest` (Go 1.25+) runs a test inside a bubble with a fake clock.
Time advances instantly whenever every goroutine in the bubble is blocked, so
a one-hour timeout test finishes in microseconds and is deterministic.

```go
import "testing/synctest"

func TestCacheExpiry(t *testing.T) {
    synctest.Test(t, func(t *testing.T) {
        c := NewCache(time.Hour)
        c.Set("k", "v")

        time.Sleep(59 * time.Minute) // instant: fake clock
        if _, ok := c.Get("k"); !ok {
            t.Fatal("entry expired early")
        }

        time.Sleep(2 * time.Minute)
        if _, ok := c.Get("k"); ok {
            t.Fatal("entry outlived its TTL")
        }
    })
}
```

`synctest.Wait()` blocks until every other goroutine in the bubble is durably
blocked — use it instead of sleeping to let a background goroutine reach a
known point.

On Go 1.24 the package is behind `GOEXPERIMENT=synctest` and the entry point
is `synctest.Run`. Below 1.24, poll with a deadline instead of sleeping.

### Detect goroutine leaks in tests

A test that leaks a goroutine passes locally and destabilises the suite.

```go
import "go.uber.org/goleak"

// Whole package, in TestMain:
func TestMain(m *testing.M) { goleak.VerifyTestMain(m) }

// Or per test:
func TestWorker(t *testing.T) {
    defer goleak.VerifyNone(t)
    // ... every goroutine started here must exit before the test returns
}
```

Add it to any package that starts goroutines. `go test -race` finds data
races; it does not find a goroutine that never exits.

## 8. Test Context, Benchmarks, and Artifacts

Use `t.Context()` (Go 1.24+) instead of `context.Background()`. It is
cancelled before `t.Cleanup` functions run, so anything blocking on it
unwinds when the test ends — including on timeout or failure.

```go
func TestFetch(t *testing.T) {
    ctx := t.Context()
    got, err := client.Fetch(ctx, "id-1") // cancelled automatically at test end
    // ...
}
```

Write benchmarks with `for b.Loop()` (Go 1.24+), not `for range b.N`. It runs
setup exactly once, keeps arguments and results alive without a sink
variable, and cannot be optimised away.

```go
// ✅ Go 1.24+
func BenchmarkEncode(b *testing.B) {
    in := makeInput()
    for b.Loop() {
        Encode(in)
    }
}

// ❌ Pre-1.24 form — needs a package-level sink to defeat dead-code elimination
func BenchmarkEncode(b *testing.B) {
    in := makeInput()
    for range b.N {
        sink = Encode(in)
    }
}
```

Report allocations with `b.ReportAllocs()` and compare runs with `benchstat`.

Two newer reporting hooks, when the toolchain supports them:

- `t.Attr("build", sha)` (Go 1.25+) emits a key/value pair into the test log
  for CI to parse.
- `t.ArtifactDir()` with `go test -artifacts` (Go 1.26+) gives the test a
  directory that survives the run — write failing golden output, captured
  HTTP bodies, or profiles there instead of into the repository.

## Anti-Patterns

- 🔴 Test with no assertions — always passes, proves nothing
- 🔴 `time.Sleep` for synchronization — use `testing/synctest`, channels, or polling
- 🔴 Test depends on execution order — each test must stand alone
- 🔴 Mocking everything — you end up testing your mocks, not your code
- 🟡 Test names like `Test1`, `TestSuccess` — name the scenario
- 🟡 Reaching into private fields — test through the public API
- 🟡 No edge cases: empty, nil, zero, max values, unicode
- 🟡 Giant shared setup — each test should set up only what it needs
- 🟢 Fuzz anything that takes untrusted input
- 🟢 Golden files for complex output comparisons
- 🟡 `context.Background()` in a test — use `t.Context()`
- 🟡 `for range b.N` on Go 1.24+ — use `for b.Loop()`

## Verification Checklist

1. Every test has meaningful assertions (no empty test bodies)
2. Test names describe the scenario, not the method
3. `t.Helper()` called in every test utility function
4. `t.Cleanup()` used for resource teardown
5. `t.Parallel()` used where safe, avoided where not
6. Integration tests guarded with `testing.Short()` or build tags
7. Mocks are minimal — only mock external dependencies
8. No `time.Sleep` for synchronization anywhere in the suite
9. Packages that start goroutines verify with `goleak`
10. Benchmarks use `for b.Loop()` and call `b.ReportAllocs()`
8. Edge cases covered: empty, nil, zero, boundary values
9. `go test -race ./...` passes
10. Coverage is meaningful, not just high numbers
