# Go Table-Driven Tests

Table-driven tests are a powerful Go idiom — when used correctly. Most
codebases either underuse them (10 copy-paste tests) or overuse them
(complex branching logic in a 200-line struct). This skill covers the
sweet spot.

Detailed reference material, loaded on demand:

- `references/patterns.md` — full worked examples: canonical tables,
  `wantErr`/`wantErrIs`, parallel tables, map-based tables, error-only
  tables, struct alignment for readability.
- `references/refactoring.md` — recognizing bloated tables and rewriting
  them as explicit subtests, with before/after examples.

Read a reference file only when the summary below is not enough for the
task at hand.

## 1. When Table-Driven Tests Shine

Use a table only when ALL of these are true:

- **Same function** under test across all cases
- **Same assertion pattern** — input in, output out, compare
- **Cases differ only in data**, not in setup or verification logic
- **3+ cases** — fewer than 3, explicit tests are clearer

Canonical use case: pure functions, parsers, validators, formatters.

```go
func TestParseSize(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    int64
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {name: "plain bytes", input: "1024", want: 1024},
        {name: "kilobytes suffix", input: "4KB", want: 4096},
        {name: "empty string", input: "", wantErr: true},
        {name: "negative size", input: "-1", wantErr: true},
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := ParseSize(tt.input)
            if tt.wantErr {
                require.Error(t, err)
                return
            }
            require.NoError(t, err)
            assert.Equal(t, tt.want, got)
        })
    }
}
```

Every case has the same shape, the loop body is a few lines, and adding
a case is one struct literal. No branching, no conditionals.

## 2. When NOT to Use Table-Driven Tests

- **Complex per-case setup** — `setupMock`/`setupFunc` function fields in
  the struct mean the table is hiding complexity. Write explicit subtests.
- **Fewer than 3 cases** — the struct definition is more code than two
  plain test functions.
- **Multiple branching paths** — `if tt.shouldError` / `if tt.wantRedirect`
  in the loop body means each branch is a different test pretending to
  share a structure. Split it.

See `references/refactoring.md` for before/after rewrites of each smell.

## 3. Struct Design Rules

1. **Every field must vary between at least 2 cases.** A field with the
   same value everywhere is setup — move it outside the table.
2. **Name the `name` field as a short sentence** describing the scenario:
   `"returns error for negative amount"`, not `"case1"` or `"success"`.
3. **`wantErr bool` for "should it error?"** — check it first and `return`
   early in the loop body.
4. **`wantErrIs error` with a sentinel** when the caller must detect a
   specific error; assert with `require.ErrorIs`.
5. **≤5 fields.** More means the scenario is too complex for a table —
   split into separate test functions.

Full field-pattern examples are in `references/patterns.md`.

## 4. The Loop Body Must Be Trivial

The point of a table test is identical execution logic for every case.
Keep the loop body under ~10 lines: call, error check, comparison.
If it accumulates conditionals or per-case setup, the table has outgrown
its usefulness — refactor into explicit subtests.

## 5. Parallel Table Tests

```go
for _, tt := range tests {
    t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
        t.Parallel()
        got := Transform(tt.input)
        assert.Equal(t, tt.want, got)
    })
}
```

- Go 1.22+ scopes the loop variable per iteration — `tt := tt` capture is
  unnecessary. For Go <1.22 the capture is still required.
- Only use `t.Parallel()` when the function under test has no side
  effects and no shared mutable state.

## 6. Refactoring Bloated Tables

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Struct has 8+ fields | Split into multiple test functions by scenario |
| `setupFunc` field in struct | Extract to separate subtests with explicit setup |
| `if tt.shouldX` in loop body | Each branch is a different test — split it |
| Same 3 fields identical in every case | Move to shared setup outside the table |
| Adding a case requires understanding all others | Table has grown beyond its useful life |

## Decision Flowchart

1. **Is the function pure (input → output, no side effects)?**
   Yes → table test is probably ideal. Go to 2.
   No → consider explicit subtests first.

2. **Do all cases share the exact same assertion pattern?**
   Yes → table test. Go to 3.
   No → explicit subtests.

3. **Can each case be expressed in ≤5 struct fields?**
   Yes → table test.
   No → split by scenario into separate test functions.

4. **Is the loop body ≤10 lines?**
   Yes → you're golden.
   No → the table is hiding complexity. Refactor.

## Verification Checklist

1. Table struct has only fields that vary between cases
2. Every case has a descriptive `name` field
3. Loop body is ≤10 lines with no branching
4. No `setupFunc` or `mockFunc` fields in the struct
5. `wantErr` is a simple bool or sentinel, not a string match
6. Cases cover: happy path, error path, edge cases (empty, nil, zero, max)
7. `t.Run` wraps each case for named subtests
8. `t.Parallel()` used only when function is side-effect-free
