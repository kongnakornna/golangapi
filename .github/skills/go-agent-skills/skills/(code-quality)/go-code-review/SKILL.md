# Go Code Review

Structured code review process for Go. Reviews should be constructive, specific,
and cite the relevant principle behind each finding.

## Operating Modes

Pick the mode that matches the request before starting:

- **Diff review** (default) — review only the changed lines plus enough
  surrounding context to judge them. Use for PRs and working-tree changes.
- **File/package review** — review the named files or packages in full,
  including their tests.
- **Full audit** — sweep the entire codebase. Use the strategy in
  "Auditing Large Codebases" below and aggregate everything into one report.

## Review Process

Execute these steps in order. For each finding, classify severity:
- 🔴 **BLOCKER** — Must fix before merge. Correctness, data loss, security.
- 🟡 **WARNING** — Should fix. Maintainability, idiomatic Go, clarity.
- 🟢 **SUGGESTION** — Consider improving. Style, naming, documentation.

## 0. Run the Toolchain First

Before reading code manually, let the tools catch the mechanical issues
(skip any tool that is not installed and note it in the report):

```bash
go build ./...          # it must compile
go vet ./...            # suspicious constructs
golangci-lint run       # if the repo has a config
go test -race ./...     # tests pass, no data races
```

Report tool findings alongside manual findings — a failing `go vet` is
an automatic 🔴 BLOCKER. Never report an issue a tool already proves
absent.

## 1. Correctness & Safety

### Error Handling
- Every error is checked. No blank identifier `_` discarding errors silently.
- Errors are wrapped with context: `fmt.Errorf("fetch user %d: %w", id, err)`.
- Error values compared with `errors.Is()` / `errors.As()`, never `==`.
- No `panic` outside of `init()` or truly unrecoverable situations.
- Errors handled exactly once — no log-and-return patterns.

### Nil Safety
- Pointer receivers checked before dereference when nil is a valid state.
- Map reads guarded or use comma-ok idiom.
- Channel operations consider closed/nil channels.
- Slice operations check bounds where relevant.

### Concurrency
- Shared mutable state protected by `sync.Mutex` or channels.
- No goroutine leaks — every goroutine has a clear termination path.
- Context propagation: all blocking calls accept and respect `context.Context`.
- `sync.WaitGroup` or `errgroup.Group` used for goroutine lifecycle.

## 2. API Design

- Exported functions have doc comments starting with the function name.
- Accept interfaces, return concrete types.
- Use functional options (`WithTimeout(d)`) over config structs for optional params.
- Context is always the first parameter: `func Foo(ctx context.Context, ...)`.
- Return `error` as the last return value.
- Avoid `bool` parameters — prefer named types or options.

## 3. Idiomatic Go

- Uses `:=` for local variables, `var` for zero-value intent.
- No unnecessary `else` after return/continue/break.
- Guard clauses and early returns reduce nesting.
- `defer` used for cleanup, placed right after resource acquisition.
- `range` used over manual index iteration where appropriate.
- Struct literals use field names.
- Interfaces defined at consumer, not producer.

## 4. Package Structure

- Package names are short, lowercase, singular nouns.
- No circular dependencies between packages.
- `internal/` used for non-public packages.
- `cmd/` contains main packages, one per binary.
- Clear separation of concerns — no god packages.

## 5. Testing

- Test functions follow `TestXxx` naming convention.
- Table-driven tests used for multiple input/output combinations.
- Test helpers use `t.Helper()` for clean stack traces.
- No test logic in `init()` — use `TestMain` when needed.
- Tests use `testify/assert` or `testify/require` consistently, or stdlib only.
- Edge cases covered: empty input, nil, zero values, max values.
- `t.Parallel()` used where safe.

## 6. Documentation

- All exported types, functions, and constants have doc comments.
- Doc comments start with the name of the entity.
- Package-level doc comment in `doc.go` for non-trivial packages.
- Complex algorithms or business logic have inline comments explaining *why*.

## 7. Dependencies

- `go.mod` has no replace directives in committed code (except monorepos).
- No unused dependencies.
- Dependencies are from well-maintained, reputable sources.
- Indirect dependencies are understood and acceptable.

## Auditing Large Codebases

When the scope exceeds ~20 files, do not read everything in one linear
pass. Split the audit into independent passes:

1. Enumerate packages (`go list ./...`) and group them by layer
   (handlers, services, stores, shared libraries).
2. Run one focused pass per concern from sections 1-7 (correctness,
   API design, idioms, structure, testing, docs, dependencies).
3. If your environment supports delegating work to parallel sub-agents
   or tasks, assign each pass to one — they are independent by design.
   Otherwise run them sequentially, one concern at a time.
4. Require every finding to cite `file.go:line` and severity so the
   final aggregation is mechanical: merge, deduplicate, sort by severity.
